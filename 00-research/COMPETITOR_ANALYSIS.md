## AI Generation Prompt

```
Analyze the competitive landscape for [YOUR APP CATEGORY].

My app concept: [2-3 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION]
Target market: [GEOGRAPHY / DEMOGRAPHIC]

For each of the top 3-5 competitors, provide:
1. Name, platform, pricing, and approximate user base
2. Their top 3 strengths (from user reviews)
3. Their top 3 weaknesses (from user complaints)
4. Their monetization strategy

Then create a feature comparison matrix and identify:
- Table-stakes features I MUST have
- Differentiators that could set me apart
- Features I can safely skip for MVP
