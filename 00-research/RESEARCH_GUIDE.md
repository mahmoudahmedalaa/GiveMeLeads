## AI Generation Prompt

```
I need help conducting pre-build research for a new app idea.

App Concept: [DESCRIBE YOUR APP IDEA IN 2-3 SENTENCES]
Target Platform: [iOS / Android / Web / Cross-platform]
My Background: [YOUR RELEVANT EXPERIENCE OR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE]

Please help me:
1. Validate the problem — Is this a real pain point? Who has it?
2. Analyze the market — Who are the top 3-5 competitors? What do they charge?
3. Identify differentiation — What could I do differently or better?
4. Assess feasibility — What are the main technical risks?
5. Suggest a business model — What's the most realistic monetization approach for an MVP?

Be honest and critical. I'd rather kill a bad idea early than waste months building it.
