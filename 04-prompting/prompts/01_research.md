# Phase 1: Research Prompts

> Use these prompts BEFORE writing your PRD.

## Market Research

```
I'm considering building [APP DESCRIPTION IN 2-3 SENTENCES].

Help me validate this idea:
1. Is this a real, widespread pain point? Who has it most?
2. Who are the top 3-5 existing solutions? What do they charge?
3. What do users complain about most in reviews of these apps?
4. What's the realistic market size for this category?
5. What would make a new entrant worth switching to?

Be honest and critical — I'd rather kill a bad idea early.
```

## Technical Feasibility

```
I want to build [APP DESCRIPTION] using [PLATFORM].

Assess technical feasibility:
1. What APIs/services exist for the core functionality?
2. Are there any platform restrictions that would block key features?
3. What are the main technical risks and how severe are they?
4. What's the minimum infrastructure cost for an MVP?
5. Are there open-source libraries that solve the hard parts?

Rate overall feasibility: Easy / Moderate / Challenging / Risky
```

## User Persona Development

```
Help me create a detailed user persona for [APP DESCRIPTION].

My target audience is [BROAD DESCRIPTION].

Create a persona with:
- Name, age, occupation, tech comfort level
- Daily routine relevant to the app
- Top 3 pain points with current solutions
- What success looks like for them
- How they'd discover and evaluate a new app
- What would make them pay vs. use free alternatives
```
