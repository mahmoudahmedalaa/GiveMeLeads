# Phase 4: Design System Prompts

```
Create a Frontend Design System document for my app.

App Style: [Modern / Minimal / Bold / Professional]
Brand Colors: [Primary hex if known, or "suggest a palette for a [type] app"]
Platform: [Web / React Native / Both]
UI Framework: [Tailwind / CSS-in-JS / React Native StyleSheet / shadcn]

Generate:
1. Color palette — Primary 50-900 scale, neutral 50-900, semantic (success, warning, error, info), all with exact hex values
2. Typography — Font families, size scale (xs-3xl in rem), weights, line heights
3. Spacing — Scale from 1-16 with rem and px values
4. Components — For each (Button, Input, Card, Modal, Alert): all variants, sizes, states, exact CSS/style values
5. Accessibility — WCAG 2.1 AA checklist: contrast ratios, focus indicators, touch targets
6. Animation — Duration, easing, what to animate, reduced-motion support

Provide exact values — no approximations. All colors as hex codes.
```
